Avoid unnecessary comments favoring doc strings and readable code. Comments are ONLY when the code itself or logs cannot explicitly state an important piece of information for understanding. Always prefer modifying existing methods and only create new ones when necessary (new functionality, abstraction, etc). Unused / redundant methods should not be left in the code. Docstrings should represent function and purpose, not changes made. Commands should be written for powershell.
If comments are excessively added, remove them and ensure the code is self-explanatory. For the powershell commands, chain using the ';' character.
